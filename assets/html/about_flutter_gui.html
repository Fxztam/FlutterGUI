<h2><span style="color: #00ccff;">How did it start?</span></h2>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">After attending the online <strong>Flutter Engage</strong> event 💙 I got so excited about the Flutter web stable release and I thought it's time to make something cool using it 👨&zwj;💻. I've already tested the beta Flutter web release when it was announced but there wasn't official support and maintenance of flutter web plugins back then.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">So I've started brainstorming and brainstorming and .... Nothing! 😬 I couldn't come up with any good idea. Throw the project to the bottom of the backlog.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">A few weeks ago I was watching a video on the Flutter Dev youtube channel&nbsp; 📺 about <strong>Draggable Widget</strong> and I thought it would be cool to make Draggable apps inside the main app. So I've started working on that and after few hours I got the first dirty prototype working. Then I've started thinking: Why not turn it into an OS like User Interface. And here we are! 😎🤩</p>
<h2><span style="color: #00ccff;">Why it looks familiar?</span></h2>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">It wasn't my main focus to make an innovative design 🤷&zwj;️ ... I was just trying to test how far I can push my technical knowledge and coding skills on getting something that works.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">While implementing the UI I got inspiration from MacOS (The OS I am currently using), Ubuntu. and I also added some <strong>Windows XP flavor</strong> 🤪.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I'm not Something of a Designer Myself.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I got some help from my little brother&nbsp;👶, who is a graphic designer, to design a new background and some unique icons.</p>
